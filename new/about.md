		<p>I'm a part-time lecturer at <a href="http://www.dmu.ac.uk/">De Montfort University</a>, teaching <span title="Haskell">'Functional Programming'</span>, 'Research' and 'Front End Web Development'. I also supervise some final year students for their projects.</p>

		<p>I am <span title="==currently">forever</span> approaching the end of my doctoral studies at <a href="http://www.dmu.ac.uk/">De Montfort University</a> under the working title:</p>
		<p><strong title="Ha-Ha!&#10;No, I'm serious actually.">‘Algorithmic Meta-Creativity.’</strong></p>
		<p>My research involves studying human and computer creativity and how they are evaluated, the absurd pseudo philosophy pataphysics and its applications, and the development of creative exploratory search algorithms inspired by pataphysical concepts.</p>
		<p>Code is written in Python. Part of this research has been described in a journal <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14626268.2013.813377#.U6li4_ldV8E">article in Digital Creativity</a> in 2013, and I presented a paper at the <a href="http://cc13.creativityandcognition.com/">Creativity & Cognition conference 2013</a> in Sydney. The prototype pataphysical search tool I created has since been used to generate the libretto 'Amorphous Isle' for an online opera called <a href="http://andrewhugill.com/theimaginaryvoyage/#">'The Imaginary Voyage'</a>.</p>

		<h3>UnCurrent</h3>
		<p>My MSc is from <a href="http://www.ioct.dmu.ac.uk/masters/">De Montfort University</a> in 2010. The major project was a publicly showcased passive interactive installation, augmenting a live video stream of users with interactive elements using motion tracking algorithms. Code was written in C++. The project report was delivered in the form of a <a href="http://msc.fania.eu">website</a> for which I received a first.</p>
		<p>I received a Bachelor of Science from the <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/computer-science/undergraduate/bsccomputerscience">University of Leicester</a> in 2007. For the major project I created a Sudoku solver, including a performance comparison between two different algorithms. All code was written in Haskell. See the <a href="images/FaniaBSc.pdf" class="h3link pdf" target="_blank">dissertation document</a> for which I received a first.</p>
